Sync To Anything Browser Example
=====

This is a short example of `pouchdb-sync-to-anything` used in the browser. It's really just here as an integration test to check that things are working as intended, and so you can try it out real quick.

How to run
----

```bash
# in this dir:

npm install

npm run build
```

Open `index.html` in a browser

You can create changes/updates, mock sync them (it does not actually syncs to any server) and read sync status
